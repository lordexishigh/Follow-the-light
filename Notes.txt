Change the aesthetic of the game
-Make it simple, but colourful and unique
-Create animation, point of this is to actually learn how to
-Once that done, try making a few scenes, google how to
-Do the grab the wall thing
-Player interacts weirdly with collisions, investigate #########
-The on collision stay causes the jump to be reseted after jumping, allowing a double jump, check it
make the pause menu script
colour theme? would work well with the light colour theme as well. 
Upon colliding with stuff, you get the colour of the object and that gets yours, or maybe you just the colour
Alternatively, gems with colours that you pick up and you get the colour?.
Can use Green, blue, purle orange?, use the colour thingy to choose.
